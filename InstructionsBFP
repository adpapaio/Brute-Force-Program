 Purpose: Brute Force, vectors, next permutation

SEND + MORE = MONEY

Description:
In this program you will write a program to solve puzzles like the one above. In the above puzzle 
you are to change the letters into digits chosen from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }, such that 
all the same letters represent the same number which makes the above equation correct. Your
program should be able to handle any three word puzzle with the operations addition, subtraction,
division, multiplication and exponentiation.

Input:
The input will come entirely from the keyboard (stdin) and will consist of typing a puzzle. A 
puzzle will be on a single line containing a three strings (in capital letters). The first two 
strings will be separated by an operator (+, - , *) and the last two strings will be separated 
by a = sign. There will be a space between each string and symbol.

Output:
There should be one line of output. The output will be the equation repeated with digits 
replacing the letters. Leading zeros should not need to be printed. If more than one solution 
is possible then list the one, where the first word has the lowest value. If not solution is
possible write no solution

Sample Input

TO + GET = HER
CAT * CAN = NATION

Corresponding Sample Output

91 + 249 = 340
no solution
